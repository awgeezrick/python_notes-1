In general in python we can make concurrency in many ways, but the most common
ones are:
- async (if we are designing something from scratch which can be I/O bound)
- threading (if we are using something which is not async but want to run
  concurrently (such as requests or other blocking libraries) and we still are
  in an I/O bound situation
- multiprocessing if we have a CPU-bound task to divide among multiple processes


In order to work with threading it is suggested to use concurrent.features and
not threading which is not that easy.
In order to work with async it is suggested to use trio (the stdlibrary module
is asyncio but it makes error handling more difficult and less flexible)

We can use threading (or better concurrent.features) with asyncio if we have an asyncio 
loop running and we want to add to the loop some sync task with threading.
Notice that this approach is good everytime we have to schedule a mix of tasks
which are both async and sync.

If we only have async tasks we can just use trio.

## Notes on GIL

The GIL is a single lock on the interpreter itself which adds a rule
that execution of any Python bytecode requires acquiring the interpreter
lock. This prevents deadlocks (as there is only one lock) and doesn't
introduce much performance overhead. But it effectively makes any
CPU-bound Python program single-threaded.
Basically the GIL affects only CPU-bound programs, as I/O bound programs
can still be dealt with async or threading.

The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) is present the standard python
implementation (i.e., CPython). The GIL prevents two threads from
executing simultaneously in the same program.
